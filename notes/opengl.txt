Here are my notes about opengl:
  It's API is something designed by otherwordly creatures without any
  consideration for sanity of us, humans, living on Earth.

  Those notes will be nothing like a official documentation, but I need
  to keep my sanity in check and there is always not enough documentation
  especially for topic like OpenGL.

That said...

1. What needs to be done to draw colorful triangle.
  a. Need to get some data about graphical "objects". For a simple triangle
     and later - isotiles and lines, we need it. In my example program I created
     GLfloat arrays full of stuff - vertices data and color data. For now that should
     suffice.
  b. Setting some attributes for GL using SDL_GL_SetAttribute and getting gl_context from
     SDL_GL_CreateContext.
  c. gl_load to GetProcAddress of gl.
  d. Using gl.

     Stuff above is JAI specific and I'm not thinking about it too much. a. is creating data -
     source of it could be anything. For now hardcoding.
