# ENGINE DESIGN DOCUMENT

## Prime usage for engine

1. Iso-tile based city builder/Patrician clone/ship sailing for trading/procedurally generated world
2. System to show inferfaces using own UI library or GetRect (depends what will be more easy to use).
3. Assets loading library.

Engine should be able to:
1. Open window, create graphics pipelines, render stuff.
2. Engine should be able to move data and configuration up and down through GUI.
   There won't be much of cmd-line data passing or input. Only setup configuration provided
   in files. Also preparing own filetypes for storing data obviously.

   This might mean preparing some tools to work on engine stuff and games.
   
3. Data-driven design. Structs, allocators, seperate functions to work on types.
   Full JAI mode.

4. Create, render, interact with iso_tiles, which are the basis of cities and ports.
5. Create, render voxel-based water. Maybe try to add some "physics" of waves?

## Game requirements

### Mechanical

1. City simulation - inhabitants have their needs to have to be met.
2. Economy! This is important. Money is not everything, people are important.
3. Transportation using boats. Obvious if we want to make a Patrician like clone.

### Technical

1. Working on IsoTiles - selection, modification, all that.
2. Voxel-based water - animated!
3. Ships sailing and floating.
4. Wind mechanics!
5. City building mechanics - building 3D voxel based structures, but not something that is 100 % voxel.
   Maybe have more of a curvature?
   Make it something like Patrician 3 style buildings.
