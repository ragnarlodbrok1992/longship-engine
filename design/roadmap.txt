# ROADMAP

## 02.04.2023

Right now engine has basing camera, way to render some really primitive primitives.
We can render isotiles, lines, make grid out of them.
Engine lacks interactivity.

## IDEAS

1. Patrician 3 clone - since I don't want it to be exact like clone, it won't be.
2. But will have ships and cities with docks - center of our gameplay.
3. Water machanics and ship-sailing - core idea for engine.
4. Iso-tile simulation, rendering, interactivity.

## TASKS

1. Implement way to render font on screen using OpenGL. Use it to write some debug text.
2. Check out and implement GetRect UI. It should be in JAI beta archive available to study and
   incorporate inside Longship Engine codebase.
3. Create "voxel-like" water. Use algorithm to create a mesh somewhat irregular and animate "waves".
4. Move code to different file - CLEANUP TASK.
5. Iso_tile modification - create new iso_tile, modify existing, add/remove tiles.
