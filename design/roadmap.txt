# ROADMAP

## 02.04.2023

Right now engine has basing camera, way to render some really primitive primitives.
We can render isotiles, lines, make grid out of them.
Engine lacks interactivity.

## TASKS

1. Implement way to render font on screen using OpenGL. Use it to write some debug text.
2. Check out and implement GetRect UI. It should be in JAI beta archive available to study and
   incorporate inside Longship Engine codebase.
3. Create "voxel-like" water. Use algorithm to create a mesh somewhat irregular and animate "waves".
